# CSCI5308 - Group 9 Project - Student MarketPlace

I have done this project in CSCI 5308 - Advanced Software Development Concepts during my Masters in Applied Computer Science.
This project is about making a marketplace for university students by identifying their email addresses and allowing only student email addresses to limit access to them. Here students can post about the rent-out places for sharing, books and the rest of the things available on the market to sell, which will make only university students a user group for this application.
